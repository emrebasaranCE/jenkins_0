### Jenkins

Hi, in this repository i will talk about my Jenkins adventure!

What is jenkins, lets answer that first.  

- As i can see for now, its a tool that lets you automize a lot of things.  

Currently, I’m following a course on Udemy, and my tutor created a CentOS VM and connected to it via SSH. According to GPT, this is a practical approach, especially since we’ll mostly be using cloud providers, and those environments are typically Linux-based.
